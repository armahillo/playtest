# Playtest

This is a simple ruby script that generates a PDF suitable for prototyping or creating print and play versions of physical card games. Great for aspiring game designers!

The script interacts with two files:

* A cards.css file, which is used to style the output
* A cards.yml file, which is used to house the data about your cards

You can customize the output by updating the HTML generated by the script and modifying the cards.css file to your liking.

Additional details about cards can be added to the cards.yml file, but must be added to the HTML that is generated. A few examples are included so you get a sense for how this works.

This script requires the [pdfkit gem](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit) to work. For this gem to work, you'll need to [install wkhtmltopdf](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/wiki/Installing-WKHTMLTOPDF) on your machine.

There is currently no way to specify quantities of cards, so each card can only be printed once per PDF that is generated. I'd like to add this in the future.

This script was hacked together so please forgive the quality or, better yet, submit a pull request so I can see how I can improve. :)
